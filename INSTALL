trackplot requires bwtool - a command line tool for processing bigWig files. Install and move the binary to a PATH (e.g; `/usr/local/bin`) or a directory under the PATH. 

| bwtool installation |

bwtool is a free C software that can be downloaded from https://github.com/CRG-Barcelona/bwtool. Please follow the following instructions for your OS to install bwtool properly on your machine.

| Linux |

| MacOS |
----------
For macOS, you must either install Xcode or the command-line tools package (if you dont have it installed already). See here for an example: https://mac.install.guide/commandlinetools/4
Once installed, follow the same compilation instructions from (a).

----------
Unfortunately bwtool is not compilable on windows

(b) Once bwtool is successfully compiled, copy the "bwtool" binary to "/usr/local/bin" or to a directory under the PATH to make bwtool available for trackplot. 
(c) As a quick test for a successful installation type "bwtool --version" in the Linux console or mac terminal.
